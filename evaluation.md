### EVALUATION


#### Evaluation without noise and disturbances

- Steady state error
- Rise time
- Settling time
- Overshoot
- Energy efficiency
- Mean square error



#### Evaluation with sensor noise

- Steady state error
- Rise time
- Settling time
- Overshoot
- Energy efficiency
- Mean square error
- Variance of output after settling time
- Number of oscillations
- Avg time to recover after a disturbance



#### Evaluation with disturbances (window state varies)

- Steady state error
- Rise time
- Settling time
- Overshoot
- Energy efficiency
- Mean square error
- Variance of output after settling time
- Number of oscillations
- Avg time to recover after a disturbance
